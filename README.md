### About
A React app that emulates Netflix (under development)

Live on: https://jsflix.netlify.app/

=> Frontend is functional but is not connected to the API yet, so clicking on "Try for 30 days free" will take you straight to the authenticated area.

### User stories*
- User can create an account with their email
- User can recover password if forgotten
- User can log in to the browse movies area
- User can scroll/swipe through different lists of movies/tv shows

*Will possibly add streaming functionality if I find a suitable API.

### Techs:

- Reactjs
- Nodejs
- PostgreSQL

### Other:
- The movie/tv shows are from TheMovieDB API (recommended).
